# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Data Processing Pipeline
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a pipeline for processing Freshdesk tickets and knowledge base articles into chunks, generating embeddings, and storing them in Qdrant with proper metadata.
# Details:
1. Implement text chunking strategies for different content types
2. Create a pipeline for processing tickets:
   - Extract relevant fields (subject, description, comments)
   - Clean and preprocess text
   - Split into appropriate chunks
   - Generate embeddings
   - Store in Qdrant with metadata
3. Create a similar pipeline for knowledge base articles
4. Implement batch processing for memory efficiency
5. Add progress tracking and logging
6. Handle attachments and extract text when possible
7. Implement incremental updates for new/modified content

Example code:
```python
class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self, freshdesk_client, embedding_service, vector_store):
        self.freshdesk_client = freshdesk_client
        self.embedding_service = embedding_service
        self.vector_store = vector_store
        
    async def process_ticket(self, ticket, company_id):
        # Extract and clean text
        texts = []
        metadata = []
        
        # Add subject and description
        texts.append(ticket["subject"] + "\n" + ticket["description"])
        metadata.append({
            "ticket_id": ticket["id"],
            "created_at": ticket["created_at"],
            "status": ticket["status"],
            "priority": ticket["priority"],
            "type": "ticket_main"
        })
        
        # Process comments if available
        if "comments" in ticket:
            for comment in ticket["comments"]:
                texts.append(comment["body"])
                metadata.append({
                    "ticket_id": ticket["id"],
                    "comment_id": comment["id"],
                    "created_at": comment["created_at"],
                    "type": "ticket_comment"
                })
        
        # Generate embeddings and store
        embeddings = await self.embedding_service.get_embeddings_batch(texts)
        
        # Store in vector database
        collection_name = await self.vector_store.create_collection_if_not_exists(
            company_id, "tickets"
        )
        
        points = []
        for i, (text, embedding, meta) in enumerate(zip(texts, embeddings, metadata)):
            points.append({
                "id": f"{ticket['id']}_{i}",
                "vector": embedding,
                "payload": {**meta, "text": text}
            })
            
        await self.vector_store.upsert_batch(collection_name, points)
        
    async def process_company_data(self, company_id, batch_size=100):
        # Process all tickets for a company
        page = 1
        while True:
            tickets = await self.freshdesk_client.get_tickets(company_id, page, batch_size)
            if not tickets:
                break
                
            for ticket in tickets:
                await self.process_ticket(ticket, company_id)
                
            page += 1
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test chunking strategies with different text types
2. Verify metadata extraction is correct
3. Test batch processing with various batch sizes
4. Validate incremental updates work correctly
5. Test with real Freshdesk data samples
6. Measure memory usage during processing
7. Verify attachment handling
8. Test error recovery during processing

# Subtasks:
## 1. Text Chunking and Preprocessing Strategies for Different Content Types [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement text chunking and preprocessing pipelines tailored for various content types (e.g., tickets, knowledge base articles). Define logic for splitting, cleaning, and normalizing text, and outline how metadata is extracted and attached. Include data flow diagrams illustrating the passage from raw input to processed chunks.
### Details:
Specify chunking rules for short-form (tickets) and long-form (articles) content. Detail preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stopword removal, and metadata extraction. Diagram the flow from raw data ingestion to preprocessed, chunked outputs.

## 2. Ticket Processing Workflow Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop the end-to-end workflow for processing support tickets, from creation and categorization to prioritization and assignment. Integrate preprocessing and chunking logic from Subtask 1. Provide a detailed data flow diagram showing each processing stage and decision point.
### Details:
Implement logic for ticket creation, initial categorization, prioritization, and assignment to agents or teams. Show how preprocessed ticket data flows through the system, including routing and escalation paths.

## 3. Knowledge Base Article Processing Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Design the workflow for ingesting, chunking, and processing knowledge base articles. Integrate preprocessing strategies from Subtask 1 and define how articles are indexed and stored with metadata. Include a data flow diagram mapping each processing step.
### Details:
Outline steps for article ingestion, chunking, metadata extraction, and storage. Show how processed articles are indexed for retrieval and linked to relevant tickets or queries.

## 4. Incremental Update and Batch Processing Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Implement mechanisms for efficient incremental updates and batch processing across both ticket and knowledge base workflows. Optimize for minimal reprocessing and fast integration of new or updated content. Provide a data flow diagram illustrating batch and incremental update logic.
### Details:
Define triggers and checkpoints for incremental updates, batch scheduling, and deduplication. Show how new or changed data is detected, processed, and merged with existing embeddings and metadata.
