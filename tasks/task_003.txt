# Task ID: 3
# Title: Set Up Qdrant Vector Database Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement connection to Qdrant Cloud for vector storage and retrieval, with support for multi-tenant data isolation based on company_id.
# Details:
1. Set up connection to Qdrant Cloud using the official Python client
2. Create a service layer for vector database operations
3. Implement collection management with company_id prefix for multi-tenancy
4. Configure vector dimensions for OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-small)
5. Implement CRUD operations for vectors with metadata
6. Set up efficient batch operations for inserting vectors
7. Implement vector search with filtering capabilities

Example code:
```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
from qdrant_client.http import models

class VectorStore:
    def __init__(self, url: str, api_key: str):
        self.client = QdrantClient(url=url, api_key=api_key)
        
    def get_collection_name(self, company_id: int, collection_type: str) -> str:
        return f"company_{company_id}_{collection_type}"
        
    async def create_collection_if_not_exists(self, company_id: int, collection_type: str):
        collection_name = self.get_collection_name(company_id, collection_type)
        collections = self.client.get_collections().collections
        if not any(c.name == collection_name for c in collections):
            self.client.create_collection(
                collection_name=collection_name,
                vectors_config=models.VectorParams(size=1536, distance=models.Distance.COSINE)
            )
        return collection_name
        
    async def search(self, company_id: int, collection_type: str, vector, limit: int = 10, filter=None):
        collection_name = self.get_collection_name(company_id, collection_type)
        return self.client.search(
            collection_name=collection_name,
            query_vector=vector,
            limit=limit,
            query_filter=filter
        )
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for vector store operations
2. Test multi-tenant isolation with different company_ids
3. Verify collection creation and management
4. Test vector insertion with various metadata
5. Validate search functionality with different filters
6. Performance testing for batch operations
7. Test error handling for database connection issues

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Connection and Collection Management with Multi-tenant Isolation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Qdrant connection and implement collection management with company_id prefixes for multi-tenant isolation
### Details:
Create a connection manager class that handles authentication with Qdrant using API keys. Implement collection naming with company_id prefixes to ensure tenant isolation. Include methods for creating, listing, and deleting collections with proper error handling for connection failures and invalid configurations. Add functionality to validate collection existence before operations and implement proper connection pooling.

## 2. Implement Vector Operations (CRUD and Search) [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop core vector operations including create, read, update, delete and similarity search functionality
### Details:
Create methods for vector operations including upsert, get, delete, and search with filtering capabilities. Implement proper dimensionality validation for OpenAI embeddings (1536 dimensions). Add support for metadata storage alongside vectors. Implement similarity search with configurable parameters like limit and score threshold. Include comprehensive error handling for vector format issues, collection not found scenarios, and API failures.

## 3. Implement Batch Processing and Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Develop efficient batch operations for vectors with performance optimization and monitoring
### Details:
Implement batch processing for vector operations to improve throughput. Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for failed operations. Create performance monitoring tools to track query latency and throughput. Implement connection pooling optimization for high-volume scenarios. Develop comprehensive testing strategies including unit tests for each operation, integration tests with a test Qdrant instance, and load testing for batch operations.
