# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup FastAPI Project Structure
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the FastAPI project with async support, Docker configuration, and project structure following best practices for a scalable backend service.
# Details:
1. Create a new Python 3.10+ project
2. Set up FastAPI with async/await support
3. Configure project structure with modules for:
   - API routes
   - Database connections
   - LLM integrations
   - Freshdesk API client
   - Utilities
4. Create Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerization
5. Set up environment variables management for API keys and configuration
6. Configure CORS and security headers
7. Implement basic health check endpoint
8. Set up structured JSON logging

Code structure example:
```
/app
  /api
    /v1
      __init__.py
      router.py
      endpoints/
  /core
    config.py
    security.py
    logging.py
  /db
    vector_store.py
  /services
    freshdesk.py
    llm_router.py
  /models
    pydantic_models.py
  main.py
Dockerfile
docker-compose.yml
.env.example
requirements.txt
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify project structure follows best practices
2. Test Docker build and container startup
3. Validate environment variable loading
4. Test health check endpoint returns 200 OK
5. Verify CORS configuration works correctly
6. Ensure logging is properly configured and outputs structured JSON

# Subtasks:
## 1. Core Project Scaffolding and Environment Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the foundational project structure and configure environment management for the FastAPI application.
### Details:
Create a `src/` directory as the root of the application containing submodules. Inside `src/`, create `main.py` to initialize the FastAPI app. Add `config.py` for environment variables and configuration management using Pydantic settings. Establish directories and files for modular components such as `router.py`, `schemas.py`, `models.py`, `service.py`, `dependencies.py`, `constants.py`, `utils.py`, and `exceptions.py` for each domain module. Use `.env` files for environment variables and configure loading in `config.py`.

## 2. API Routing and Middleware Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Implement API routing with FastAPI routers and configure middleware for request handling and cross-cutting concerns.
### Details:
Define routers in each module's `router.py` to group related endpoints. Register these routers in `src/main.py` to compose the full API. Set up middleware in `main.py` for tasks such as CORS, logging, authentication, and error handling. Use FastAPI's dependency injection system via `dependencies.py` to manage shared dependencies and middleware logic. Ensure async support for routes and middleware for scalability.

## 3. Database and Service Integration Foundations [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Integrate database models, migrations, and service layers to support business logic and data persistence.
### Details:
Create `models.py` in each module for SQLAlchemy ORM models following naming conventions. Use Alembic for database migrations. Implement service logic in `service.py` to encapsulate business rules and database interactions. Configure database connection settings in `config.py` and initialize the database session in `main.py` or a dedicated `database.py` module. Ensure async database support if using async drivers. Define Pydantic schemas in `schemas.py` for request/response validation.

## 4. Docker Containerization and Deployment Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Containerize the FastAPI application using Docker and prepare deployment configurations for production environments.
### Details:
Create a `Dockerfile` based on the official Python image, copying the `src/` directory and installing dependencies from `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`. Configure the container to run the FastAPI app with an ASGI server like Uvicorn. Write a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files. Provide instructions or scripts to build and run the Docker image (`docker build -t myimage .` and `docker run -d -p 80:80 myimage`). Optionally, prepare deployment manifests or configurations for orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. Manage environment variables securely in the container runtime.
