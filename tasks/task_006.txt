# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement LLM Router Pattern
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a router service that can dynamically select and use different LLM providers (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini) with fallback mechanisms.
# Details:
1. Create a unified interface for different LLM providers
2. Implement provider-specific adapters for:
   - Anthropic Claude
   - OpenAI GPT models
   - Google Gemini
3. Create a router that can select the appropriate model based on:
   - Availability
   - Cost
   - Performance requirements
   - Specific capabilities
4. Implement automatic fallback mechanisms
5. Add monitoring and logging for model usage
6. Implement caching for common requests
7. Add rate limiting and quota management

Example code:
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
import asyncio
from enum import Enum

class ModelProvider(Enum):
    ANTHROPIC = "anthropic"
    OPENAI = "openai"
    GOOGLE = "google"

class LLMAdapter(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def generate(self, prompt: str, max_tokens: int = 1000, temperature: float = 0.7):
        pass
        
class AnthropicAdapter(LLMAdapter):
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, model: str = "claude-3-opus-20240229"):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.model = model
        # Initialize Anthropic client
        
    async def generate(self, prompt: str, max_tokens: int = 1000, temperature: float = 0.7):
        # Implement Anthropic API call
        pass
        
class OpenAIAdapter(LLMAdapter):
    # Similar implementation for OpenAI
    pass
    
class GeminiAdapter(LLMAdapter):
    # Similar implementation for Google Gemini
    pass
    
class LLMRouter:
    def __init__(self, adapters: dict[ModelProvider, LLMAdapter], default_provider: ModelProvider):
        self.adapters = adapters
        self.default_provider = default_provider
        self.fallback_order = [default_provider] + [p for p in adapters.keys() if p != default_provider]
        
    async def generate(self, prompt: str, provider: ModelProvider = None, **kwargs):
        if provider is not None and provider in self.adapters:
            try:
                return await self.adapters[provider].generate(prompt, **kwargs)
            except Exception as e:
                # Log error and fall back to default
                pass
                
        # Try providers in fallback order
        for fallback_provider in self.fallback_order:
            try:
                return await self.adapters[fallback_provider].generate(prompt, **kwargs)
            except Exception as e:
                # Log error and continue to next provider
                continue
                
        # If all providers fail
        raise Exception("All LLM providers failed to generate response")
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for each adapter
2. Test fallback mechanisms with simulated failures
3. Verify router correctly selects providers
4. Test with various prompt types and lengths
5. Measure response times across different providers
6. Test rate limiting behavior
7. Validate error handling
8. Test caching effectiveness

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Core Interface and Provider Adapters [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational interface for the LLM router and implement provider-specific adapters
### Details:
Design a unified interface that abstracts different LLM providers. Implement adapter classes for major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mixtral, etc.) that conform to this interface. Include authentication handling, request formatting, and response parsing for each provider. Define clear interface contracts with method signatures for query processing, completion generation, and error handling.

## 2. Implement Router Logic and Selection Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop the core routing logic with selection criteria and fallback mechanisms
### Details:
Create the router component that dynamically selects the appropriate LLM based on query characteristics. Implement selection criteria including cost optimization, performance requirements, and specialized capabilities. Design fallback mechanisms for handling failures or timeouts. Create sequence diagrams showing the routing decision process and fallback flows. Implement a scoring system (1-5) to evaluate model suitability for different query types.

## 3. Build Monitoring, Caching, and Rate Limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Implement performance monitoring, response caching, and rate limiting functionality
### Details:
Develop monitoring systems to track router performance, model selection accuracy, and cost metrics. Implement caching mechanisms to store and reuse responses for similar queries. Create rate limiting functionality to manage API quotas across different providers. Design interfaces for monitoring data collection and visualization. Implement configurable thresholds for automatic routing adjustments based on performance data.
