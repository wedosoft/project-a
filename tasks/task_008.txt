# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement API Endpoints for Ticket Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 5, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create FastAPI endpoints for ticket initialization, summarization, and context retrieval to support the Freshdesk Custom App frontend.
# Details:
1. Implement `/init` endpoint for ticket initialization and summarization
2. Create request/response models using Pydantic
3. Add authentication and validation middleware
4. Implement error handling and appropriate status codes
5. Add rate limiting for API endpoints
6. Implement logging for request tracking
7. Add company_id validation and isolation

Example code:
```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException, Request
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Optional

router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/v1")

class TicketInitRequest(BaseModel):
    ticket_id: int
    company_id: int

class TicketSummary(BaseModel):
    summary: str
    key_points: List[str]
    sentiment: str
    priority_recommendation: Optional[str] = None

class TicketInitResponse(BaseModel):
    ticket_id: int
    summary: TicketSummary
    context_id: str  # Session identifier for subsequent requests

@router.post("/init", response_model=TicketInitResponse)
async def initialize_ticket(request: TicketInitRequest, req: Request):
    try:
        # Get ticket data from Freshdesk
        freshdesk_client = req.app.state.freshdesk_client
        ticket = await freshdesk_client.get_ticket(request.ticket_id, request.company_id)
        
        # Generate summary using LLM
        context_manager = req.app.state.context_manager
        llm_router = req.app.state.llm_router
        embedding_service = req.app.state.embedding_service
        
        # Create prompt for summarization
        prompt = await context_manager.create_prompt(
            "summarize", ticket, request.company_id, embedding_service
        )
        
        # Generate summary
        summary_text = await llm_router.generate(prompt)
        
        # Parse summary into structured format
        # This would typically use another LLM call or parsing logic
        summary = TicketSummary(
            summary=summary_text,
            key_points=["Point 1", "Point 2"],  # Extracted from summary
            sentiment="positive",  # Analyzed from ticket
            priority_recommendation="medium"
        )
        
        # Generate a context ID for this session
        context_id = f"ctx_{request.ticket_id}_{int(time.time())}"
        
        # Store context in cache for subsequent requests
        # req.app.state.cache.set(context_id, {...})
        
        return TicketInitResponse(
            ticket_id=request.ticket_id,
            summary=summary,
            context_id=context_id
        )
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for API endpoints
2. Test input validation with various payloads
3. Test authentication and authorization
4. Verify error handling for different scenarios
5. Test rate limiting behavior
6. Validate response formats match specifications
7. Test with mock Freshdesk data
8. Measure response times under different loads

# Subtasks:
## 1. Core Endpoint Implementation with Request/Response Models [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core FastAPI endpoints for ticket processing with Pydantic models for request/response validation
### Details:
Create FastAPI routes for ticket creation, retrieval, and processing. Define Pydantic models for ticket data validation. Implement serialization/deserialization of ticket data. Set up proper route handlers with appropriate HTTP methods. Document API specifications with OpenAPI annotations.

## 2. Authentication, Validation, and Error Handling Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement middleware components for authentication, request validation, and standardized error handling
### Details:
Create authentication middleware using JWT or OAuth. Implement request validation middleware to ensure data integrity. Develop comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes. Set up logging for API requests and errors. Create middleware for rate limiting and request throttling.

## 3. Integration with Context Management and LLM Services [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Integrate the API with context management systems and LLM services for ticket processing
### Details:
Set up Redis queue integration for asynchronous ticket processing. Implement LangChain integration for LLM-based ticket categorization and prioritization. Create service layer for context management across API calls. Develop sequence diagrams for each endpoint showing interaction flow. Implement multi-tenant isolation for ticket processing.
